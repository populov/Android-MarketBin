So, if you want to check that a subset of certain markets (where your app is published) is installed on user's device, you can make your own list for verification. The order in this list is significant for search sequence. So it's recommended to place most desirable items in the beginning of list and vice versa. Also I recommend to place at the end of list a \"fallback\" item, that shows a google play (for example) website in browser, if no available markets detected.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nIMarketDescriptor[] myAppPublishedIn = {\r\n    MarketBin.getGooglePlay(),\r\n    MarketBin.getSamsungApps(),\r\n    MarketBin.getSlideMe(),\r\n    MarketBin.getGooglePlayWeb()\r\n};\r\nIMarketDescriptor market = locator.findFirst(Arrays.asList(myAppPublishedIn));\r\n```\r\nDynamic extending\r\n------------\r\nYou can add your own markets without need to modify library source code. Just create a new MarketDescriptor item With market name, market client package name (if you know it), and template of package location URL (you can find it in store API documentation), where **%s** is a place, where your application id (usually package name) will be placed.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nIMarketDescriptor googlePlay = new MarketDescriptor(\"Google Play\", \"market://details?id=%s\", \"com.android.vending\");\r\n```\r\nOdd use\r\n-------\r\nMarket locator can be used to check whether some application is installd or some URI scheme handler is present. So, you can, for example, easily check if user has Bitcoin wallet installed and make clicable links for Bitcoin addresses.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nMarketLocator locator = new MarketLocator(context);\r\nIMarketDescriptor donation = new MarketDescriptor(\"Bitcoin Donation\", \"bitcoin:%s\", null);\r\nboolean bitcoinProtocolHandlerFound = locator.findByIntent(Arrays.asList(donation)) != null;\r\nif (bitcoinProtocolHandlerFound)\r\n    MarketUI.bindAppLink(textView, donation, \"17g6FWQh8iF8C2MAQhoyYAvxtpYXdMbfbd\");\r\n```\r\nUse in Android Studio\r\n--------------\r\n### Online dependency ###\r\nThe easyest way to use - you don't need to build project yourself, just add a few lines in your *gradle.config*.\r\n\r\n1. Add Haunted Soft maven repository in project repositories section (*don't mix it up with buildscript repositories, that usually goes first*).\r\n\r\n    ```groovy\r\n    repositories {\r\n        mavenCentral()\r\n        maven { url \"http://dl.bintray.com/haunted-soft/maven\" }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n2. Add project depencency as usual. You also should add to dependencies JetBrains annotations library, if you still don't use it.\r\n\r\n    ```groovy\r\n    dependencies {\r\n        compile 'com.haunted.marketbin:MarketBin:+@aar'\r\n        compile 'org.jetbrains:annotations:+@jar'\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Local dependency (build from source) ###\r\nIf you want to have latest version, that has not been published yet, or build from modified sources, the easyest way is to depend on local Maven repository in your project.\r\n\r\n1. Download sources, build MarketBin project with gradle and execute **uploadArchives** task to publish library in local Maven repository.\r\n\r\n    ```shell\r\n    git clone git@github.com:Haunted-Soft/MarketBin.git\r\n    cd MarketBin\r\n    gradle build uploadArchives\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n2. Add mavenLocal repository in project repositories section (*don't mix it up with buildscript repositories, that usually goes first*)\r\n\r\n    ```groovy\r\n    repositories {\r\n        mavenCentral()\r\n        mavenLocal()\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n3. Add project dependency as usual (see above).\r\n\r\nDonations\r\n=========\r\nYou can donate me some virtual coins, if you like **MarketBin** library and especially if it helps you earn real money :)\r\n\r\nBitcoin: [17g6FWQh8iF8C2MAQhoyYAvxtpYXdMbfbd](bitcoin:17g6FWQh8iF8C2MAQhoyYAvxtpYXdMbfbd)\r\n\r\nLitecoin: [Lcz35NNdPap6X8GVgudVP9nwWxbYMvRgpi](litecoin:Lcz35NNdPap6X8GVgudVP9nwWxbYMvRgpi)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
